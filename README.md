[View Changelog](https://compbiocore.github.io/jupyterfleet/html/changelog.html)

JupyterFleet is a cohesive utility to deploy and configure a group of AWS instances running Jupyter for teaching

It is currently under active development (as of 3/1/18) and should not be used for production deployment in its current state.  Many features are only partially implemented, or have only been tested with one set of parameters.  A beta fully-functional build is expected to be ready around 3/9/18.
