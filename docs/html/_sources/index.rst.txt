Purpose
=======

This site serves to describe the 'JupyterFleet' software being developed by the Brown Computational Biology Core for the purpose of quick and easy Jupyter deployment on AWS.  The software is under active development so some features are missing and bugs are to be expected at this stage - **it should not be run in its current form without consulting Andrew Leith** (see contact information below).  JupyterFleet receives instructions from a YAML file and proceeds to instantiate AWS instances and deploy Jupyter notebooks on them with a single command.

The software (in its provisional state) can be found at the following repository:

https://github.com/compbiocore/jupyterfleet

Please note that this tool has not been tested on Windows; furthermore, no such testing on my part is planned at this time.  If you are interested in taking on this responsibility, excellent!  Please open an issue on Github and we can proceed from there.

Pip and Conda installations will be available pending a production build.
